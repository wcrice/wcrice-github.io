My name is Bill Rice and I am a graduate student in the [Hydrologic Sciences](https://www.hsgg.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis. I am a geologist by trade and training but my current research revolves around water management, water policy, quantifying water budgets, and the development of Groundwater Sustainability Plans under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.
