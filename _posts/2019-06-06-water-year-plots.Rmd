# Estimating Annual Precipitation and Moving Averages

In the United States of America the common definition of a water year among hydrologists is from October 1st to September 30th. This script walks you through pulling data from the NOAA Climate Data search tool and building a graph showing annual precipitation over each water year in the dataset.

Start by visiting [NOAA's Climate Data Search Tool](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) and downloading a CSV formated file containing daily precipitation.
